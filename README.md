# Simple basic Javascript hacking starter using only Webpack 4, ESLint, and Webpack Dev Server.

There will be more starters built on top of this using React, Angular, Typescript, full Testing suites.
This is just so I can go from reading a tutorial to a simple runnable app in a pinch.

1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm start:dev`
